## 🎌 What We Do

My Japanese Name Translator is a free online tool for instantly converting English names into Japanese using four writing systems — **Katakana (カタカナ)**, **Hiragana (ひらがな)**, **Kanji (漢字)**, and **Romaji**. We use phonetic transliteration based on standard Hepburn romanization rules to produce natural-sounding, culturally appropriate Japanese name equivalents.

- **Katakana Conversion** - The standard Japanese script for foreign names, used on official documents and passports
- **Hiragana Rendering** - Soft, flowing script representation for a traditional Japanese feel
- **Kanji (Ateji) Translation** - Characters selected for their phonetic readings, visually striking and meaningful
- **Romaji Output** - Accurate romanized spelling using Hepburn romanization

## 🔧 Core Features

### English to Japanese Name Conversion
Convert English names into all four Japanese writing systems with:
- Instant, real-time conversion in your browser
- Curated database of common English name translations
- Phonetic mapping algorithm for uncommon names
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for each result
- Script toggle buttons to show/hide individual writing systems

### How the Converter Works
Our tool uses phonetic transliteration to map each English syllable to its closest Japanese phonetic equivalent:
1. **Name Input** — Enter your English name
2. **Database Lookup** — Check against our curated common name database
3. **Phonetic Mapping** — Apply Hepburn romanization rules to convert pronunciation
4. **Script Generation** — Produce Katakana, Hiragana, Kanji (ateji), and Romaji output
5. **Display Results** — Show all four writing systems with copy buttons

### Popular Name Conversions
The tool includes a curated database of pre-verified translations for popular English names (both male and female), ensuring the highest accuracy for common names. Users can click any popular name to instantly see its Japanese conversion.

### Educational Content
The site includes detailed explanations of:
- Japanese writing systems (Katakana, Hiragana, Kanji) and their uses
- Japanese phonetics and mora-based syllable structure
- How foreign names are adapted to Japanese sounds (e.g., "L" → "R", "V" → "B")
- Common uses for Japanese names (tattoos, hanko seals, business cards, gaming)
- Japanese honorific suffixes (-san, -chan, -kun, -sama)

## 🔍 Key Japanese Name Elements

### Katakana (カタカナ)
Angular script used for foreign names, loanwords, and emphasis. This is the **standard and officially recognized** way to write non-Japanese names in Japan — used on passports, official documents, and business cards.

### Hiragana (ひらがな)
Curved, flowing script for native Japanese words, grammar particles, and furigana pronunciation guides. Provides a softer, more traditional feel for name representations.

### Kanji (漢字)
Logographic characters from Chinese, each carrying meaning. Our tool uses **ateji** — kanji characters selected for their phonetic readings rather than semantic meaning — to create visually striking name representations.

### Romaji (ローマ字)
Romanization of Japanese using the Latin alphabet. We use the **Hepburn system**, the most widely recognized romanization standard used in Japan.

## 🚀 Technical Approach

Our name conversion runs entirely **client-side in your browser** — no names are sent to any server. The technical methodology includes:

- **Hepburn romanization** — The internationally recognized standard for Japanese transliteration
- **Phoneme-to-Katakana mapping** — Comprehensive mapping table covering standard and extended katakana
- **Common name database** — Pre-verified translations for 50+ popular English names
- **Katakana-to-Hiragana conversion** — Unicode-based character offset conversion
- **Ateji kanji mapping** — Phonetic kanji character selection for name rendering
- **English phonetic rules** — Substitution rules for sounds not native to Japanese (th → s, ph → f, l → r, v → b, etc.)

## 🌟 Why Accurate Japanese Name Translation Matters

Japanese names carry deep cultural and linguistic significance. An inaccurate or inappropriate translation can cause misunderstanding or unintended offense. Our tool ensures translations are:
- **Phonetically precise** — Following standard Hepburn romanization
- **Culturally appropriate** — Respecting Japanese naming conventions
- **Clearly explained** — Providing romaji pronunciation for every result
- **Safely recommended** — Noting that Katakana is always the safest choice for foreign names
